To start the application, make sure that the [backend](https://github.com/kutoru/chat-app-backend) is already set up and running, and then enter
```
npm run dev
```

Note that you might also need to change the backend's IP setting. To do that, go into `./src/global.ts` and adjust the `BACKEND_URL` constant
